# Task mining overview

Task mining is a process that allows organizations to capture detailed steps for each process in order to streamline workflows. This can be done independently or collaboratively with colleagues using flows. For more information on flows, refer to [Overview of the types of flows in Power Automate](flow-types.md).

With task mining, your organization can discover tasks taking place on desktops and zoom in on specific tasks identified during the process mining analysis. By monitoring recorded user actions and collecting data, your organization can gain insights into how it performs process tasks, identify common mistakes made during task performance, and pinpoint tasks that can be automated.

Task mining is a powerful tool for organizations looking to optimize their business processes. By analyzing user actions and data, organizations can identify inefficiencies and bottlenecks in workflows, streamline processes, and reduce costs. Additionally, task mining can help build a culture of continuous improvement where employees are encouraged to seek out ways to optimize their work processes.

## Business example

In a retail company, task mining using Process Advisor can be used to analyze the order fulfillment process. By recording user actions and collecting data, the organization can gain insights into how orders are processed, identify inefficiencies and bottlenecks, and pinpoint tasks that can be automated.

For example, process advisor can automatically produce a process map that visualizes the order fulfillment process. This can help the organization identify which activities take the longest, how many variations of the order fulfillment process there are, and what variations and actions take the most time.

Application analytics and analytics dashboards can also show which applications teams spend the most time in, and which activities can be optimized. With this information, the organization can create cloud flows with automation recommendations that reveal which connectors to use based on their workflows.

Using insights and guided recommendations from process advisor, the retail company can streamline the order fulfillment process, reduce errors, and improve customer satisfaction. Additionally, the company can automate repetitive tasks, allowing employees to focus on more value-added activities such as customer service and inventory management.
