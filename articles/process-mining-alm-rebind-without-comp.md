# Rebind reports without using a composite model

To use your new model in Power BI, *rebind* redirects live connect reports in the Power BI service. The rebind method you choose depends on whether the two processes you have are using two different workspaces or the same workspace.

## With two different workspaces

If you linked your process in Test environment to a workspace (for example, WkSpace B) that's different from the one used by the process in Dev environment (for example, WkSpace A), follow the steps in this section.

### Attach a workspace to your process

1. In the **Environments** dropdown menu at the top of the screen, select your Test environment.
1. On the navigation pane to the left, select **Process mining**.

    If your process was newly copied over to the Test environment, there's an exclamation mark inside a speech bubble on the process. This mark indicates that the process was imported.

1. Select the process, and then select **Confirm**.
1. If you newly imported the process, continue to step 5. If you didn't newly import the process, go to step 6.

1. Select a new workspace for this process by following these steps:
    1. In the **Power BI workspace** dropdown menu, select a *different* workspace, which you'll use in the Test environment.
    1. In the **Report Name** field, enter the same report name as your previous report.

        > [!IMPORTANT]
        > The report name must be identical to your previous report.

    1. To continue setting up the process, select **Continue**.

       :::image type="content" source="media/process-mining-alm-rebind-without-comp/new-workspace.png" alt-text="Screenshot of selecting a new workspace for your process with the same report name as your previous report.":::

1. (If you didn't do step 5) Attach a custom Power BI workspace to the process:
    1. Go to the process details page for the process.
    1. On the **Details** card, select **Edit**.
    1. From the **Power BI workspace (optional)** dropdown menu, select your **WkSpace B** Power BI workspace that you want to migrate customizations to.
    1. Provide the same report name as the name you used for the process in Dev environment.

        > [!IMPORTANT]
        >
        > The report name must be identical to the report name of the process in Dev environment.

    1. Select **Save** > **Continue**.
    1. From the command bar or in the report view, select **Refresh data**.

### Rebind the Power BI report (different workspaces)

1. Sign in to [Power BI](https://msit.powerbi.com/).
1. From the left navigation pane, select **Workspaces** > your **WkSpace A**.
1. In your **WkSpace A**, select your **Report A**.
1. To download the report from the command bar, select **File** > **Download this file** > **"A copy of your report with a live connectionâ€¦"** > **Download**.
1. Open the downloaded report in Power BI for desktop.
1. After you edit the report, select **Transform data** > **Data source settings** from the command bar in the **Home** tab.
1. From the list of semantic models, select the semantic model of the process that's in your **WkSpace B** workspace, and then select **Connect**.

    This is called *rebinding*. The report refreshes. Learn more about semantic models in [Semantic models in the Power BI service](/power-bi/connect-data/service-datasets-understand).

    :::image type="content" source="media/process-mining-alm-rebind-without-comp/semantic-model.png" alt-text="Screenshot of rebinding your process after you download, edit, and connect your model.":::

1. Save the report by selecting **Save**.
1. To publish, from the command bar, select **Publish**.
1. From the **Publish to Power BI** menu, select your **WkSpace B** > **Select**.

    A message that says **Replacing report** appears because you retained the report name.

1. Select **Replace** to overwrite the old report in WkSpace B. This action overwrites the existing report with an updated version that incorporates the new customizations. It also preserves the original report name for consistency.

    :::image type="content" source="media/process-mining-alm-rebind-without-comp/replacing-report.png" alt-text="Screenshot of how to replace a report.":::

1. When this process completes, return to Power BI and open **WkSpace B**.

    The report is now successfully migrated from WkSpace A and is connected to the semantic model of the process you had in your WkSpace B.

## With the same workspace

If you linked your process in Test environment to a workspace (for example, WkSpace A) that's the same as the workspace used for the process in Dev environment (for example, WkSpace A), follow the steps in this section.

1. [Attach a workspace to your process](#attach-a-workspace-to-your-process) by following steps 1 through 3 in this article.

1. If you newly imported the process, continue to step 3. If you didn't newly import the process, go to step 4.

1. Select the same workspace for this process by following these steps:
    1. In the **Power BI workspace** dropdown menu, select the *same workspace* as the previous workspace.
    1. In the **Report Name** field, enter a *different* report name from your previous report name.

        > [!IMPORTANT]
        > The report name must be different from your previous report name.

    1. To continue setting up the process, select **Continue**.

       :::image type="content" source="media/process-mining-alm-rebind-without-comp/new-workspace-same.png" alt-text="Screenshot of selecting a new workspace for your process with the same report name as your previous report.":::

1. (If you didn't do step 3) Attach a custom Power BI workspace to the process:
    1. Go to the process details page for the process.
    1. On the **Details** card, select **Edit**.
    1. From the **Power BI workspace (optional)** dropdown menu, select your **WkSpace B** Power BI workspace that you want to migrate customizations to.
    1. Provide a *different* report name from the name you used for the process in Dev environment.

        > [!IMPORTANT]
        >
        > The report name must be different from the report name of the process in Dev environment.

    1. Select **Save** > **Continue**.
    1. From the command bar or in the report view, select **Refresh data**.

### Rebind the Power BI report (same workspace)

Some of the steps in the following procedure are the same as the steps for rebinding when using different workspaces. These steps guide you to the previously described steps with a link. As you complete the steps, return here to complete the steps for rebinding when using the same workspace.

1. To download your report in Power BI, do steps 1 through 5 in [Rebind Power BI report (different workspaces)](#rebind-the-power-bi-report-different-workspaces).

(#rebind-power-bi-report).
1. From the **File** menu, select **Save as**.
1. Enter the *same name* for the report as your Report B, and then select **Save**.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > Make sure you to do this step to ensure that this report overwrites Report B when you publish.

    :::image type="content" source="media/process-mining-alm-rebind-without-comp/save-as-same.png" alt-text="Screenshot of how to overwrite a report.":::

1. From the command bar in the **Home** tab, select **Transform data** > **Data source settings**.
1. From the list of semantic models, select the semantic model of the process that's in the Test environment and whose report is in your **WkSpace A**, and then select **Connect**.

    Since you're using the same workspace for both your processes in Dev and Test, the location of the semantic model you select is your **WkSpace A**. This is called *rebinding*.

    :::image type="content" source="media/process-mining-alm-rebind-without-comp/semantic-same.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the new report in your WkSpace A location.":::

    The report refreshes. Learn more about semantic models in [Semantic models in the Power BI service](/power-bi/connect-data/service-datasets-understand).

1. **Save** the report.
1. To publish, from the command bar, select **Publish**.
1. From the list of destinations, select **WkSpace A** > **Select**.

    A message that says **Replacing report** opens, indicating you gave the report the same name as your old Report B.

1. To overwrite the old report in WkSpace A, select **Replace**.

1. When this process completes, return to Power BI and open **WkSpace A**.

    The customizations from Report A are now successfully transferred to Report B in the same **WkSpace A**.
