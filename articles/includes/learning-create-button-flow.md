    3. To the right, notice a **Dynamic content** box popped up. To show, in the subject line, the exact date and time the button was pressed, select **Date** and **Timestamp**.

1. Select the **team icon** on your flow to add a co-owner.

## Summary
In this lesson, you've seen how to **create a button flow**. 

In minutes, the flow gave a warehouse worker the ability to **alert the team** to a **delivery arrival**, so that the team didn’t have to stand around and wait, wasting valuable time they could spend on other tasks. 

The worker then shared that button out to the team, so others could trigger the same flow if that person wasn’t around.
