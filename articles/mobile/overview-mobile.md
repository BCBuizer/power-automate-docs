## Limitations

The Power Automate mobile app for Android has a few limitations:

- Geofencing, or using location-based triggers, isn't supported. This was formerly a preview feature. <!--10/17 Natalie/Kartik to LMK if this applies to iOS-->

- You can run flows in the mobile app, but not create or edit them. Customers told us that they prefer to create and edit their flows in Power Automate on the web. If you're on the go and need to create or edit a flow, open Power Automate in your mobile device's web browser.
