1. On the **Approvals** screen, select the vertical ellipsis (**â€¦**) next to a request, and then select **Details**.

## Create custom responses

You can also create your own responses to approval requests. For example, you might want to respond with **Need more info** before you either **Accept** or **Reject** a request. [Learn how to create custom responses](../create-approval-response-options.md).
