# Use flows in Excel for the web

Integrate Power Automate with Excel for the web to automate repetitive tasks, reduce errors, and improve productivity. For example, you can track customer feedback, manage projects, or analyze data. By connecting Excel to apps and services like Microsoft SharePoint, Teams, and Planner, Power Automate can make collaboration and data sharing across different platforms seem effortless.

With this feature, you can easily create Power Automate workflows in Excel for the web. To get started, select a Power Automate prebuilt template that closely meets your needs. Then, customize it to fit your Excel workbook.

Here are some of the prebuilt templates you can use in Excel for the web:

- Monitor incoming emails to an alias in an Excel worksheet
- Track Planner tasks in Excel
- Categorize Excel rows with GPT
