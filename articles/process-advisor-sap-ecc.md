# Use the SAP ECC beta connector

## Questions for Heather

- Is your GitHub alias "HeatherOrt"? I used Derah's name for now.
- Let's start with an action verb, such as "Use the SAP ECC beta connector".
- We should lowercase beta connector unless it's officially part of a product name (feature names are lowercase).
- Please complete the **description** in line 2.
- Do you know where in the process advisor node in the TOC it should go? Here's a suggestion: under **Process advisor** > **Overview**, or last in the **Process mining** sub-section.
