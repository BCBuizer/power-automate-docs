# Create an environment variable with SAP connection parameters (preview)

[This article is prerelease documentation and is subject to change.]

SAP has multiple connection parameters, and manually entering the parameters into each Power Automate cloud flow action can be time-consuming. The preview SAP Integration solution available for [download](https://github.com/jongilman88/PowerPlatformSAPIntegration) includes an environment variable JSON string template for entering all of your SAP system information. Once your environment variable is defined, you can reuse it in your SAP actions without having to reenter it.

## Define the environment variable

1. Sign in to [Power Apps](https://make.powerapps.com) to [create an environment variable in a solution](/power-apps/maker/data-platform/environmentvariables#create-an-environment-variable-in-a-solution).

1. Select **Solutions** in the left navigation panel.

1. Open the **SAP Integration** solution.

1. On the command bar, select **New** > **More** > **Environment variable**.

1. Complete the fields in the Environment variable panel.

    - **Display name**: Enter a display name for the environment variable.
    - **Name**: This name is automatically generated as you enter the display name, but you can change it.
    - **Data Type**: Select **Text** (_don't_ select JSON). Once selected, the value fields will appear.
        
        - **Default Value**: Offers an environment variable template.
        - **Current Value**: Update the JSON blob with the SAP system's SAP properties. Not all properties are necessaryâ€”your SAP environment will determine which ones are applicable. Refer to the SAP property guidance.

| AppServerHost        | The hostname of the SAP application Server. |
| AppServerService     | The service name or port number of the specific SAP application server to connect to (Optional if connection type (Logon) is A - Application Server). |

| MessageServerHost  | The hostname of the SAP system's message server (central instance) also known as R3 system name (Mandatory if connection type (Logon) is B - Message Server (Group)).  |
| MessageServerService | The service name (as defined in etc/services) or the port number under which the message server is listening for load-balancing requests (Mandatory if connection type (Logon) is B - Message Server (Group) and system ID isn't present). |
| SncCertificate  | The secure network connector (SNC) X.509 certificate in Base64 encoded form, without the begin or end certificate tags. |
| SncMyName  | The installed SNC solution usually knows its own SNC name. For solutions supporting multiple identities, you may need to specify the identity to be used for this destination/server (optional). |

## Reuse the environment variable in a flow

Environment variables are available in a flow's dynamic content selector. Go into an SAP Integration cloud flow to select the environment variables to reuse in [SAP actions](/connectors/sap/#actions).

1. [Edit a solution-aware cloud flow.](/power-automate/edit-solution-aware-flow)
1. In a flow action, select **Add dynamic content** to open the dynamic content selector. All environment variables that you have access to are listed.
1. Select the desired environment variable.
1. Select **Save**.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> Any time an environment variable is updated in a cloud flow, the updated values are not automatically used the next time the flow runs. The updated flow must be **deactivated and reactivated** for the updated values to take effect.
