# Use and update UI elements collections

> [!NOTE]
> An Attended RPA license is required to include and use UI elements collections in desktop flows, given that access to the flow designer of Power Automate for desktop is needed.

You can include UI elements collections in desktop flows through the [Assets library](assets-library.md) using Power Automate for desktop's designer.

To use Assets library, select **Assets library** in the designer.
