# Create desktop flow connections

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Before using a machine to run desktop flows from the cloud, ensure that the machine is secured and the machine's admins are trusted.

Before using the **Run desktop flow** action in your cloud flow to trigger a desktop flow, you need to create a connection to your machine. To create a connection:

1. Sign in to [Power Automate](https://make.powerautomate.com), go to **Data** > **Connections**,  and then select **New connection**.

1. Search for **Desktop flows**, and then select the appropriate result.

1. Provide the machine (or on-premises data gateway) information and device credentials:

   - **Connect**: Select if you want to connect to a machine, a machine group or an on-premises data gateway.

      To connect to a machine or a machine group, select **Directly to machine**, and choose the appropriate machine or machine group in  **Machine or machine group**.

   - **Password**: Your accountâ€™s password.
