# View desktop flows analytics

As an admin, you'll need to view the overall status of automation that runs in your organization. There are three options to monitor the analytics for automation that's built with desktop flows:

1. [Desktop flow activity](desktop-flow-activity.md) (directly in Power Automate)  
1. The Power Platform [admin center](https://aka.ms/ppac).
1. The [Center of Excellence (CoE) Starter Kit](/power-platform/guidance/coe/setup).
