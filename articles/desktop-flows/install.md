# Install Power Automate

Before you install Power Automate on your device, make sure that it meets the [system requirements](requirements.md).

You can download and install Power Automate [using an MSI installer](#install-power-automate-using-the-msi-installer) or [from Microsoft Store](#install-power-automate-from-microsoft-store). The Microsoft Store installation doesn't require you to have admin rights on your device and is updated automatically regularly. The MSI installer requires admin rights and requires manual updates. However it also includes an option to install the machine runtime application which allows you to [manage machines from the Power Automate portal](https://learn.microsoft.com/power-automate/desktop-flows/manage-machines). You can use the Power Automate for desktop store installation in conjunction with the runtime application which you can install from the MSI.

By default, Power Automate for desktop honors the proxy settings specified in Windows. To override this configuration for the Power Automate console, refer to [Power Automate for desktop using a proxy server](governance.md#configure-power-automate-for-desktop-to-interact-with-a-corporate-proxy-server). To configure proxy settings for the machine runtime, please see how to [override them after install](https://support.microsoft.com/topic/power-automate-for-desktop-proxy-setup-8a79d690-1c02-416f-8af1-f057df5fe9b7).
