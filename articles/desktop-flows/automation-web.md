# Automate webpages

Power Automate offers several actions under the browser automation group to enable users to interact with web browsers. Browser automation is a special case of UI automation used for interacting with web elements.

Apart from the built-in Automation browser, four web browsers are currently supported:

- Microsoft Edge
- Microsoft Internet Explorer
- Google Chrome
- Mozilla Firefox

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To interact with browsers, you need to install the appropriate browser extension and configure the browser accordingly. You can find more information regarding the supported browsers and the required extension in [Use browsers and manage extensions](using-browsers.md).

Browser automation is achieved by launching or attaching to one of the supported browsers and then deploying browser automation actions. Development may be performed manually or through the [use of the recorder](recording-flow.md).

The actions of this group enable users to interact with web pages and emulate events, such as clicking, using JavaScript scripts.

By default, browser automation actions don't move the actual mouse on the screen. However, some actions like the **Click link on web page** and **Populate text field on web page** support physical interactions for cases where JavaScript events don't work as expected.

Browser automation actions can run even when the web browser is minimized, or the target tab isn't the focused tab. This functionality allows you to perform other activities on your computer while a browser automation flow is running.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you enable physical interaction in a browser automation action, the browser can't be minimized, and the target tab must be focused.

## Building a browser automation flow

To begin a browser automation flow, use one of the browser-launching actions: **Launch new Microsoft Edge**, **Launch new Internet Explorer**, **Launch new Chrome**, or **Launch new Firefox**. You can start a new browser session or attach to an existing one.

After the browser instance is stored in a variable, you can deploy other browser automation actions to interact with the browser's content. The web form filling actions focus on providing input to web pages, while the web data extraction actions draw data from web pages.

Most browser automation actions require you to specify a browser instance and a UI element to interact with. You can find a list with all the available browser automation actions in the [Browser automation actions reference](actions-reference/webautomation.md).

:::image type="content" source=".\media\web-automation\web-action-inputs.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the inputs of the Populate text field on web page action.":::

Existing UI elements are displayed in the UI element pane, while new ones can be added directly through the action's properties or the pane. To find more information about UI elements and their different types, refer to [Automate using UI elements](ui-elements.md).

> [!NOTE]
> Browser automation actions accept exclusively UI elements captured from web pages. Therefore, existing UI elements captured from desktop applications aren't displayed in the browser automation actions.

:::image type="content" source="media\web-automation\adding-new-elements-through-a-web-action.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the available UI elements in the Populate text field on web page action.":::

To add a new UI element, highlight the appropriate web element and press **Ctrl + Left click**. After adding all the required elements, select **Done** to save them to the UI elements pane.

## Data population on the web

To provide input to a web page, select the appropriate web form filling action depending on the nature of the element, and specify the browser instance.

:::image type="content" source="media\web-automation\set-drop-down-list-value-on-web-page-action.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Set drop-down list value on web page action.":::

## Web data extraction

To extract a piece of data from a web page, use the **Get details of web page** or the **Get details of element on web page** action, depending on whether the data in question concerns the entire web page or an element inside it. You can find more information regarding details extraction from web pages in [Retrieve details from a web page](how-to/retrieve-details-web-page.md).

:::image type="content" source="media\web-automation\get-details-of-web-page-action.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Get details of web page action.":::

Apart from the pre-populated options, you can manually select to retrieve any HTML attribute the selected web element may have.

Additionally, the **Get details of element on web page** action supports the **waelementrectangle** attribute that retrieves the top-left point and the dimensions of a web element. You can find more information regarding this attribute in [Get the coordinates and size of a web element](how-to/get-coordinates-size-web-element.md).

:::image type="content" source="media\web-automation\get-details-of-element-on-web-page-action.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Get details of element on web page action.":::

### Web extraction of structured data

To extract large amounts of structured data, use the **Extract data from web page** action. You can store the extracted data as single values, lists, and tables or you can paste them into Excel worksheets.

:::image type="content" source="media\web-automation\extract-data-from-web-page-action.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Extract data from web page action.":::

When you deploy the action, right-click on the data you want from the web page to view the available extraction options. To extract a value, select **Extract element value**, and then choose the HTML attribute that you want to extract.

:::image type="content" source="media\web-automation\extracting-data-from-web-page.png" alt-text="Screenshot of a web page while extracting data from it.":::

Power Automate automatically identifies lists or tables of data after you select two or more of their elements for extraction.

>[!NOTE]
> To extract an entire HTML table faster, you can right-click on the table, and then select **Extract entire HTML table**. This option is available only to elements that Power Automate recognizes as HTML tables. If the data is structured as a table but it isn't recognized as an HTML table, extract the first two of their elements, as previously described.

:::image type="content" source="media\web-automation\extracting-data-table-from-web-page.png" alt-text="Screenshot of a web page while extracting a data table from it.":::

Additionally, you can manually create or edit CSS selectors that pinpoint specific elements.

To create a CSS selector, select **Advanced settings** in the live web helper, and then choose the type of value you want to extract. You can choose to extract a single value, multiple handpicked values (a different selector defines each value), lists, tables, and entire HTML tables.

Each CSS selector consists of the tree structure of the HTML element, the attribute to extract from it, and optionally a regular expression to implement more advanced selection.

:::image type="content" source="media\web-automation\extracting-web-data-css-selector.png" alt-text="Screenshot of a CSS selector.":::

## Interacting with the web and web services

Power Automate provides various HTTP actions to allow users to communicate directly with web resources, such as web pages, files, and APIs, without the need of a web browser. You can find a list with all the available HTTP actions in the [HTTP actions reference](actions-reference/web.md).

### Downloading web resources

Use the **Download from web** action to directly download web page content or files stored on the web.

Both the **GET** and **POST** methods can be used with this action. The files can be downloaded directly to the disk, while web page contents are saved into a variable.

:::image type="content" source="media/interacting-web-services/download-from-web-action.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Download from web action.":::

### Accessing web APIs

Use the **Invoke web service** action to access web APIs. Various methods are compatible with this action, which is fully customizable in order to accommodate virtually any API.

> [!NOTE]
> Before using the **Invoke web service** action, refer to the documentation page of the web service you want to use. The example presented in the following screenshot can't be applied to all scenarios, as each web service requires a different configuration and syntax.

:::image type="content" source="media/interacting-web-services/invoke-web-service-action.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Invoke web service action.":::

Apart from the **Invoke web service** action, Power Automate provides the **Invoke SOAP web service** action to interact with SOAP web services.

## Use the actual Internet Explorer vs the Automation browser

Although Automation browser is based on Internet Explorer, it provides some features and limitations that increase automation effectiveness.

1. Automation browser works out of the box, while Internet Explorer requires [extra configuration](install-browser-extensions.md). Security configurations may be unwanted in organizations with strict security policies that prohibit manual changes.

1. The **Click download link on web page** action works with Automation browser whatever the Internet Explorer version. For the actual Internet Explorer, the action requires version 8 or below.

1. Automation browser suppresses all message dialog boxes that may pop up unhindered in the actual Internet Explorer. If this feature is undesirable, apply the **(ShowDialogs)** suffix at the end of the URL in the **Launch new Internet Explorer** action.

1. Automation browser doesn't support tabs or opening links in windows. When you click on a link, the browser opens it in the same window/instance.

1. Automation browser has a small performance advantage because it doesn't load unnecessary elements and add-ons like the actual Internet Explorer does.
