# Using custom actions in desktop flows (preview)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Power Automate for desktop v2.32 and newer is required

You can include custom actions (preview) in desktop flows through the [Assets library (preview)](./assets-library.md).

Though Power Automate for desktopâ€™s designer open the Assets library (preview). 
You can do that either through the dedicated button
