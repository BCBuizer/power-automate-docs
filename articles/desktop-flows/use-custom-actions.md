# Using custom actions in desktop flows (preview)

[!INCLUDE[cc-preview-features-top-note](../includes/cc-preview-features-top-note.md)]

You can include custom actions in desktop flows through the [Assets library (preview)](assets-library.md) using Power Automate for desktop's designer.

To use Assets library, select **Assets library (preview)** in the designer.

## Custom actions (preview) tab

[Custom actions (preview)](custom-actions.md) tab shows you the custom actions uploaded in the environment you've selected.

> [!NOTE]
> You can only see custom actions shared with you.

After you complete the custom action inclusion and close the asset library, the custom actions will be listed at the bottom of the **Actions** tree under the **Custom Actions** section.
