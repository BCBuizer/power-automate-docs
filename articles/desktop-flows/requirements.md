# Prerequisites and limitations

This article presents all the prerequisites and limitations you should consider before installing and using Power Automate on your desktop.

## Prerequisites

- To [install Power Automate](install.md), a Windows account with administrator privileges is required.

  > [!IMPORTANT]
  > Microsoft Store installations don't require users to have admin rights to install.

- An account to sign in to Power Automate. To see what features are available for each account type, go to [Sign-in account comparison
](#sign-in-account-comparison).

- A device with the following hardware:

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > The hardware requirements don't include the resources required for the applications involved in the desktop flows.

  Minimum hardware:
  - Processor: 1.00 GHz or faster with two or more cores. For unattended mode, four or more cores are needed.
  - Storage: 1 GB
  - RAM: 2 GB

  Recommended hardware:
  - Processor: 1.60 GHz or faster with two or more cores. For unattended mode, four or more cores are needed.
  - Storage: 2 GB
  - RAM: 4 GB
  - GPU acceleration
  - .NET Framework 4.7.2 or later

- A device that runs Windows 10 (Home, Pro, Enterprise), Windows 11 (Home, Pro, Enterprise), Windows Server 2016, Windows Server 2019 or Windows Server 2022. Devices with ARM processors aren't supported.

    If your device runs Windows 10 Home or Windows 11 Home, you can use Power Automate to create desktop flows and monitor them on the [portal](https://powerautomate.com). However, you can't trigger desktop flows from the cloud and run other types of desktop flows (Windows recorder V1 and Selenium IDE).

## Known issues and limitations

- Only work or school account users with Dataverse database provisioned in their default environment can create Power Automate desktop flows. Power Automate desktop flows will be stored in the default environment with the Dataverse database.

    If the Dataverse database doesn't exist in the default environment, the user won't be able to create desktop flows and be prompted to create a database. There will be no connectivity of Power Automate desktop flows with cloud flows.â€¯ 

    After users create the Dataverse in the Power platform admin center, they might get prompted to create it again. In this scenario, exit Power Automate for desktop from the system tray icon to restart it.

- If users have signed in with trial or paid accounts and want to connect their free Microsoft accounts, they have to use Power Automate for desktop version 2.6.48.21069 or above. Otherwise, they'll encounter the following error.  

    :::image type="content" source="media\known-issues\pad-sign-in.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the prompted sign-in dialog with the respective error.":::

- Power Automate applies the proxy configuration specified in Windows proxy settings. If the proxy server requires authentication, the administrator has to exclude Power Automate from using it or use another server that doesn't require authentication. You can find more information regarding bypassing proxy servers in [Configure Power Automate to bypass a corporate proxy server](governance.md#configure-power-automate-for-desktop-to-bypass-a-corporate-proxy-server).

- The number of actions that can be logged in a single desktop flow run is limited to 10,000. Extra actions will be performed but won't be logged.
