# View work queues (preview)

[This article is pre-release documentation and is subject to change.]

To view the list of work queues you have either created or that have been shared with you:

1. Go to [Power Automate](https://make.powerautomate.com/) and sign in with your credentials.
2. On the left menu, select the Monitor section.
3. Select Work queue (preview) from the list of options.

If you have already created work queues or if any work queue has been shared with you, you will see a list similar to this.
