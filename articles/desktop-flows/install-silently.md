1. Use commands to navigate to the directory in which you've downloaded the Power Automate installer. This directory is usually the **Downloads** folder.

   ```CMD
    cd C:\Users\Admin\Downloads\
   ```

1. Run the following command to run the installer and complete the setup of Power Automate.

   ```CMD
   Setup.Microsoft.PowerAutomate.exe -Silent -Install -ACCEPTEULA
   ```

   >[!IMPORTANT]
   > You must provide the "-ACCEPTEULA" argument to indicate that you accept the [terms and conditions](/dynamics365/legal/slt-power-automate-desktop) for Power Automate.

## Command line argument details

You can use the help menu of the command prompt to see all the available command line arguments for the Power Automate installation.

## Uninstall Power Automate silently

## Install an on-premises data gateway with PowerShell cmdlets

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Gateways for desktop flows are now deprecated except for China region. Switch to our machine-management capabilities. To learn more, go to [Switch from gateways to direct connectivity](manage-machines.md#switch-from-gateways-to-direct-connectivity).

To find information regarding how to install, configure, and manage a gateway using PowerShell cmdlets, go to [PowerShell Cmdlets for On-premises data gateway management](/powershell/gateway/overview). To use the presented cmdlets, you must run them from PowerShell 7.0.0 or higher with elevated permissions.
