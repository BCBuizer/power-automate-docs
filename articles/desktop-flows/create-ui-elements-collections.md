# Create UI elements collections in desktop flows

UI elements collections 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - This feature requires Power Automate for desktop v2.43 or later.



## Known limitations

- Custom actions groups can't exceed 30 MB upon upload.
- Specific endpoints must be included in the allowlist for desktop flows containing custom actions to work properly. More information: [Desktop flow services required for runtime](../ip-address-configuration.md#desktop-flows-services-required-for-runtime)
- Application lifecycle management (ALM) isn't fully supported for desktop flows with dependencies on custom actions.
- Upload date might differ in the portal than what is shown in the Assets library inside Power Automate for desktop.
- The Assets library can't display more than 5000 custom actions groups.
