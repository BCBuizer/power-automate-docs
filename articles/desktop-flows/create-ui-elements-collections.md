# Create UI elements collections in desktop flows

Creating and publishing a UI elements collection is possible through the flow designer of a desktop flow. In the UI elements pane, there are now two different tabs available, **Flow repository** and **Collections (preview)**.

The **Flow repository** tab contains all the UI elements that are available only to that particular desktop flow. Older desktop flows that have been created with version 2.42 or previous than that, which contain UI elements, now display those elements under the Flow repository tab.

> [!NOTE]
> - The UI elements collections is a [premium feature](premium-features.md), available only to organization premium or trial users. Users with a free Microsoft account do not have access to UI elements collections.

To create a new collection of UI elements, the said UI elements have to be captured first in the desktop flow.

> [!NOTE]
> - Any new UI element that is captured via the button **Add UI element** will be automatically added under the Flow repository tab. You can't add a UI element directly into a collection.
