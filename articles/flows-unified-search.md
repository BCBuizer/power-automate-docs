# Find the flows, templates, and information you need

When your creative juices start *flowing*, you might create many flows. With unified search, finding your flows is easy&mdash;just use the search box on the **My flows**, **Team flows**, **Connections**, or **Solutions** screen to display only flows that match the search terms you enter.

> [!NOTE]
> The search filter only finds flows that have been loaded into the page. If you don't find your flow, try selecting **Load more** at the bottom of the page.

To learn more about managing search providers and more, go to [Find it with unified search](/power-apps/maker/search).
