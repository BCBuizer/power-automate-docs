# Cancel or resubmit flow runs in bulk

You can cancel runs in batches of 20 runs. If you have hundreds of runs to cancel, you can use a template.

## Resubmit flow runs

You can resubmit previous runs of a flow in bulk. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Sign in to [Power Automate](https://make.powerautomate.com).
1. On the left panel, select **My flows**.
1. On the right panel, select the cloud flow that you would like to resubmit or cancel.
1. Select **All runs**.

   > [!TIP]
   > - The flow must have runs to cancel or resubmit the flow runs.
   > - You can resubmit or cancel up to 20 flows at a time.

1. Select the flow runs that you would like to resubmit or cancel on the **Run history** page.
1. Select **Resubmit flow run(s)**.

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > The number of flows that you can resubmit is limited based on the maximum number of API calls for the connectors in the flow.

## Cancel flow runs

To cancel flow runs that are in progress, follow the steps outlined previously in [Resubmit flow runs](#resubmit-flow-runs) with one exception: In step 6, select **Cancel flow run(s)**, as shown in the following screenshot.

This template cancels runs at approximately five (5) runs per minute. You might be subject to throttling if you change the delay period in the template flow.

This template isn't available for sovereign cloud customers.

Follow these steps to cancel flow runs using a template: 

1. Obtain the **Environment ID** and **Flow ID**. Ask your administrator to find these IDs in the [Power Platform admin center](https://admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com/home).
1. Sign in to [Power Automate](https://make.powerautomate.com).
1. Access the [Cancel all my flow runs template](https://aka.ms/cancelAllMyRunsTemplate).
1. Select **Continue** to sign in to **HTTP with Microsoft Entra ID (preauthorized)** <!--still says Azure AD. Explain "preauthorized".-->
1. Add an action by selecting the plus sign (**+**), and then select **Add an action**.
1. In the search field, start to type **HTTP with Microsoft Entra ID (preauthorized)**, and then select **Invokee an HTTP request** when you see it in the list.

    The action configuration pane appears on the left with the **Parameters** tab selected.

1. Enter the following parameters:
    1. Leave the **Gateways** box unchecked.
    1. In the **Base Resource URL** field, enter `https://api.flow.microsoft.com`.
    1. In the **Azure AD Resource URI (Application ID URI)** field, enter `https://service.flow.microsoft.com`.
