# Application lifecycle management in Process Mining overview

ALM (application lifecycle management) encompasses the entire lifecycle of applications, including governance, development, and maintenance. It incorporates various disciplines such as requirements management, software architecture, development, testing, maintenance, change management, support, continuous integration, project management, deployment, release management, and governance.

For an overview of ALM in Power Platform, go to [Overview of application lifecycle management with Microsoft Power Platform](/power-platform/alm/overview-alm).

You can migrate all your process mining entities, including dataflow connections, custom metrics, Power BI reports, and more, from one environment to another, or in the case of Power BI reports, from one workspace to another.

If you want to migrate your process mining entities from one environment to another except your customized Power BI reports using Power Platform solutions, go to [Migrate Process Mining entities with Power Platform solutions](process-mining-alm-entities-solutions.md).
