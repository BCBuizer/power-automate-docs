# Manage sequential approvals with Power Automate

Some workflows require pre-approval before the final approver is required to sign off. For example, a company may have a sequential approval policy that requires pre-approval for invoices over $1000.00 before they're approved by the Finance department.

In this tutorial, you create a sequential approval flow that manages employee vacation requests. For detailed information about using SharePoint with Power Automate, go to the SharePoint documentation.

For detailed information about using SharePoint with Power Automate, go to the [SharePoint documentation](/sharepoint/dev/business-apps/power-automate/sharepoint-connector-actions-triggers).

> [!NOTE]
> SharePoint is used here only as an example. It isn't required to create approval flows. You can use any of the more than 200 services with which Power Automate integrates to drive your flows. If you're using SharePoint 2010, go to [SharePoint 2010 workflow retirement](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2138686).

## Detailed steps in the flow

The flow:

1. Starts when an employee creates vacation request in a [SharePoint Online list](https://support.office.com/article/Introduction-to-lists-0a1c3ace-def0-44af-b225-cfa8d92c52d7).
1. Adds the vacation request to the approval center and then emails the request to the pre-approver.
1. Emails the pre-approval decision to the employee.
1. Updates the SharePoint Online list with the pre-approver's decision and comments.
   Note: If the request is pre-approved, the flow continues with these steps:
1. Sends the request to the final approver.
1. Emails the final decision to the employee.
1. Updates the SharePoint list with the final decision.

This image summarizes the preceding steps:

## Prerequisites

[!INCLUDE [prerequisites-for-modern-approvals](includes/prerequisites-for-modern-approvals.md)]

For the purposes of this walkthrough, the SharePoint Online list that you create must include the following columns:

The SharePoint Online list you create must include the following columns:

| Title                   | Single line of text    |
|-------------------------|------------------------|
| Vacation start date     | Date and time          |
| Vacation end date       | Date and time          |
| Comments                | Single line Of text    |
| Approved                | Yes/No                 |
| Manager comments        | Multiple lines Of text |
| Modified                | Date and time          |
| Created                 | Date and time          |
| Pre-approved            | Yes/No                 |
| Created By              | Person or group        |
| Modified By             | Person or group        |

Make  note of the name and URL of the SharePoint Online list. We use these items later when you configure the **SharePoint - When a new item is created** trigger.

Power Automate uses either the classic designer or the Edit with Copilot (preview) designer. To identify which designer youâ€™re using, go to the **Note** section in [Understand the Edit with Copilot designer (preview)](../flows-designer.md).

## Create your flow

# [Classic designer](#tab/classic-designer)

[!INCLUDE [sign-in-and-create-flow-from-blank-template](includes/sign-in-and-create-flow-from-blank-template.md)]

[!INCLUDE [add-trigger-when-sharepoint-item-created](includes/add-trigger-when-sharepoint-item-created.md)]

1. On the **When an item is created** card, select the **Site Address** and the **List Name** for the SharePoint list that you created earlier.

## Get the manager for the person who created the vacation request

# [Classic designer](#tab/classic-designer)

[!INCLUDE [add-get-manager-action](includes/add-get-manager-action.md)]

   > [!NOTE]
   > It's a good idea to periodically save changes to your flow as you go.

# [Edit with Copilot (preview)](#tab/edit-with-copilot)

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](./includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

---

## Add an approval action for pre-approvals

# [Classic designer](#tab/classic-designer)

[!INCLUDE [add-an-approval-action](includes/add-an-approval-action.md)]

This action sends the pre-approval request to the email address in the **Assigned To** box.

# [Edit with Copilot (preview)](#tab/edit-with-copilot)

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](./includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

---

## Add a condition

# [Classic designer](#tab/classic-designer)

[!INCLUDE [add-approval-condition-response](includes/add-approval-condition-response.md)]

> [!NOTE]
> This condition checks the response from the **Start and wait for an approval** action.

# [Edit with Copilot (preview)](#tab/edit-with-copilot)

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](./includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

---

## Add an email action for pre-approvals

# [Classic designer](#tab/classic-designer)

[!INCLUDE [add-action-to-send-email-when-vacation-approved](includes/add-action-to-send-email-when-vacation-approved.md)]

   ![configure pre-approved email template.](./media/sequential-modern-approvals/yes-email-config.png)

## Get the pre-approver's manager

# [Classic designer](#tab/classic-designer)

1. Use the [Get the manager for the person who created the vacation request](sequential-modern-approvals.md#get-the-manager-for-the-person-who-created-the-vacation-request) steps we did earlier to add, and then configure another **Get manager** action. This time we get the pre-approver's manager.
2. The **Get manager 2** card should resemble this image when you're finished. Be sure to use the **Email** token from the **Get manager** category on the **Add dynamic content from the apps and services used in this flow** card.
