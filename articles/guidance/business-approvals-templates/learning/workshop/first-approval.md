# Creating First Approval Kit workflow

## Task 1 - Create a Contoso Coffee Machine Request

By completing the App In a Day module 2 or having the Contoso Coffee Application imported into your environment you will have the ability create a machine request. Lets review the the request process before you proceed with creating the Business Approval for this process.

1. Select the Data tab and make sure you have at least one record in the table.

## Task 2 - Create Approvals Kit Workflow

Now that you have verified that Contoso Coffee machine request can be successfully created lets create a simple one stage and one node approval process that you can self approve.

> NOTE: If you do not have the Approvals Kit installed in your environment the [Approvals Kit Setup Guide](../../setup.md) or the [Instructor Guide](../instructor-guide/overview.md) could help your Center of Excellence team or Trainer provide an environment so that you can follow this workshop module

1. Select **Apps**, select the â€¦ button of the **Business Approval Management** and select **Play**.

1. If prompted select your account and enter your account password.

1. Select **Continue** to close the welcome screen if it appears

1. Select **Configure a Workflow** from the Home navigation item

  > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
  ![Screenshot of Approvals Kit workflow process saved successfully](./media/approvals-kit-workflow-saved.png)

## Task 3 - Publish Approval Workflow

Having created the definition of you work flow the next step is to publish the workflow so that you can trigger a approval when a Machine request is created.

1. Select **Publish**.

1. Verify that the workflow can be published and select **Publish**.

  > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
 ![Screenshot of Approvals Kit workflow process saved successfully](./media/approvals-kit-workflow-publish.png).

1. Wait for the workflow to be published. You can use the **Refresh** to update the publish status.

  > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]

## Summary

In this module you stepped through the process of creating a Contoso Coffee Machine request, defined a simple Approval workflow and published the first version of this workflow.

The publish task created an active version of you work flow. As you change and adapt a workflow you can publish new versions to react to changing business rules or revert back to an earlier version.

The next [Trigger Approval](./trigger-approval.md) module will build on these two elements to use a Power Automate Cloud flow to begin a approval workflow every time a Machine request is submitted.
