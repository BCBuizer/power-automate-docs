## attributeName

returns the event/case attribute value

**Output Data Type**: BOOL, INT, STRING, FLOAT, TIME, DATE

**Example**: `MAX(eventCost)`

Metric applicable on process map calculates the maximum cost of the event per activity. Attribute name - eventCost - is case insensitive, valid formats are also for example EVENTCost, eventcost, or EventCOST.

**Example**: `GetValue("ivoice total")`

If the attribute contains space in the name, it is not possible to write it directly as part of the custom metric expression. In such cases use the operator GetValue to access the value of a given attribute.
