The Settings section allows you to set the general options and default configuration of Minit, define the working hours calendar templates, and update the application or license.

Access settings from the Project hub by selecting the cogwheel in the application toolbar. Changes in the settings are applied only after selecting **Save**. Unsaved changes are indicated by an asterisk next to the section name.

## Tasks history

The history of performed tasks such as process import or data export from a view is listed here.

Select **...** next to each task to display further options. If a task could not be completed, you can select **Retry task** to restart, or you can edit its parameters before restart by selecting **Edit task**. You can also cancel ongoing tasks by selecting the option **Cancel task** and display the result of the task by selecting **View result**.

If you want to see more information about the task, including error messages in case of failed tasks, expand the task details by selecting the arrow.

## Working hours

The Working Hours section allows you to define calendar templates that can be applied to process views in the Process explorer in order to influence the performance analysis calculation, which is by default performed on a 24/7 basis. For more information about this section, go to [Working hours](working-hours.md). The overview of your configured connections can be found here. Use the **Add connection** button to add a new connection. Use the **X** button at the right end of the connection item to delete the corresponding connection.

## About

The program version information is shown here. When a new update is available, a blue **Update** button appears.
