# Minit overview

Take advantage of additional enterprise process mining capabilities with the minit  overview. For example, there are many ways to break down your process cycles into smaller pieces for analysis. With the minit, you can easily delve into the details of your processes.

To fully use minit, you need an add-on to unblock the enterprise process mining capabilities. To learn how to install the desktop app, go to [Install minit](how-to-start-with-minit-desktop-application.md).

## Business example

Minit analyzes data from processes that you create using process mining capabilities. For example, you can get deep insights into how your processes run, uncover the root cause of problems, and build useful outputs for the rest of your organization.

Minit keeps you informed about progress toward key process indicators (KPIs). As it does this, it also helps you with the following tasks:

- Understand where and why problems occur
