# Edge conditional filter (preview)

[!INCLUDE[cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

This case-level filter is similar to the Attribute (conditional) filter, only it is related to edges (instead of events). Both Activity-Based Process Map as well as Resource-Based Social Chart edges are supported. This is the first selection - process map based attribute:

If there are defined resource attributes in the active process, the dropdown offers to select Resource attributes:

As we are dealing with edges, the available condition is limited to either Case-Level Attributes or edge-related metrics. For example, you want to find all cases where edge Approving -> Demand for information occurs, but only those where this edge happened for a certain Supplier or Region, or the mean duration of this edge exceeds a certain KPI. (If we used Resource-Based attribute, the list of edges follows resource transitions for example, Lara Obrien -> Azalia Hansen.)

To do that, select the additional criteria type Case-Level Attribute/Edge Metric/Process metric:

And specify the value(s) for it:
