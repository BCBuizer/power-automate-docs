# Case attributes conditional filter

The **Attributes (conditional)** filter adds conditions to the **Attribute** filter. Use it, for example, to find all cases where an approval activity occurs, but only if a specific resource executed the approval or the duration of the activity exceeds a certain KPI.

1. Select the filter **Attributes (conditional)**.

1. In the **and at the same time** list, select a criteria type, either **Attribute**, **Metric**, or **Process Metric**.

   **Process metric** calculates the total value for all cases in the process. In the view filtering, it returns either empty (0% cases) or full (100% cases) for data set coverage. It's reasonable to use process metrics for filters in business rules, where you can deactivate or activate the business rule by filtering out the whole data set.

1. Select an attribute, metric, or process metric and the corresponding value or values.
