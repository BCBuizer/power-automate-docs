# Install minit

Before you can start using minit, you need to install it from the process mining capability.

1. Sign in to [Power Automate](https://make.powerautomate.com).

1. On the panel to the left, select **Process advisor**.

1. At the top of the process mining screen, select **Install Minit**.

1. Open the installer file when prompted, and then select **Install** to run the installer.

   Allow a few minutes for the installer to download and install the application files.

1. When the minit welcome screen opens, select the preferred application language and select **Next step** to start the guided configuration wizard.

1. In the next step, accept the terms of use and confirm the choice of telemetry data collection, and then select **Next step**.

1. By default, the installation process will store process mining data in a new **Minit** folder in the **Documents** folder in your OneDrive. Change the location if necessary, and then select **Next step**.

    If the selected folder has been used before, minit will let you choose whether you want to use the content of the folder (for example, data and settings from a previous installation), or cleanup the folder. Select **Use** or **Cleanup** to specify your choice. To go back and change the storage location, select **Cancel**.

1. Select **Apply and Mine!** to finish the wizard.
