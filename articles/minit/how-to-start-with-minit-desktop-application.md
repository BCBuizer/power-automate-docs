1. Open the installer file when prompted, and then select **Install** to run the installer.

   Allow a few minutes for the installer to download and install the application files.

1. When the welcome screen opens, select the preferred application language and select **Next step** to start the guided configuration wizard.

1. In the next step, accept the terms of use and confirm the choice of telemetry data collection, and then select **Next step**.

1. By default, the installation process will store process mining data in a new **Process Mining desktop app** folder in the **Documents** folder in your OneDrive. Change the location if necessary, and then select **Next step**.

    If the selected folder has been used before, the Process Mining desktop app lets you choose whether you want to use the content of the folder (for example, data and settings from a previous installation), or cleanup the folder. Select **Use** or **Cleanup** to specify your choice. To go back and change the storage location, select **Cancel**.

1. Select **Apply and Mine!** to finish the wizard.

1. Sign in to the Process Mining desktop app with your work account.
