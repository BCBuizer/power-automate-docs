1. Open the installer file when prompted, and then select **Install** to run the installer.

   Allow a few minutes for the installer to download and install the application files.

1. When the minit welcome screen opens, select the preferred aplication language and click **Next step** to start the guided configuration wizard.

1. In the next step accept the terms of use and confirm the choice of telemetry data collection, then select **Next step**.

1. By default, the installation process will store process mining data in a new **Minit** folder in the **Documents** folder in your OneDrive. Change the location if necessary, and then select **Next step**.

   > [!NOTE]
   >
   > If the selected folder has been used before, minit will let you choose whether you want to **Use** the content of the folder (e.g., data and settings from previous installation) or **Cleanup** the folder. Selecting **Cancel** will navigate you back and allow you to change the storage location.

1. Select **Apply and Mine!** to finish the wizard.

1. Sign in to minit with your work account.

1. Start process mining from the **Processes** screen.
