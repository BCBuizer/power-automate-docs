## How was the Suggested actions evaluated? What metrics are used to measure performance? 
We have a robust set of metrics we're tracking to measure the performance of the model and resulting customer experience. We track the feature’s SLA to make sure it's always available to you. We track the telemetry of thumbs up and thumbs down gestures present in the UI experience for each AI output that you can submit feedback for. 
You can provide feedback on this functionality when the results are biased or inappropriate. We track this feedback to ensure that AI feature is compliant, appropriate, and bias-free.  
We have meticulously tested the AI model through various internal processes and reviews in order to make sure that we provided the best possible quality and adhere to the highest of standards when it comes to security and reliability. 
 
## What are the limitations of the suggested actions? How can the users minimize the impact of feature when using the system? 
The suggested actions capability can only propose actions currently available in the Power Automate for desktop’s standard library of actions. It cannot propose actions that are custom-made by an organization (custom actions).
